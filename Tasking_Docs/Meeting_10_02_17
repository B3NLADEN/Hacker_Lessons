What will we name the business? I was thinking PWN PEN & PARTNERS (PP&P)? We need something that will let people know what type of industry that we are in

notes from the actual Meeting:
We shold focus on developing a mailing list when we begin working on our content (this can later be harnessed)
We also must work on disclaimers prior to releasing work in order to protect us from improper useage
What type of content should we create?
  * Short video's that are not overly technical in nature
  * Reach cybrer practictioner who have no technical foundation as well as the novice
  * Security for dummies (transitioning Noobs and uneducated folks from novice to professional)

****Recognition (what is our longterm plan?? Hobby or Business (firm)

****Content should be together as well as dispursed meaning that we all will be required to develop content individually and teach that content
this leads to other concern that we should address in our next meeting


*****Teaching offense and defense (this is an intersting concept)
*****Think like a hacker to stop one!!!
*****Finish the python text 

I will be generating a follow-on list of questions for the next meet up
